# Project Feedback

## Project Workflow

>Did you complete the user stories, wireframes, task tracking, and/or ERDs, as specified above? Did you use source control as expected for the phase of the program youâ€™re in (detailed above)?

**Meets Expectations**. Nice work coming up with a working project in 3 days! Would like to see more specific user stories from the perspective of someone playing the game, using the app, etc. As we move forward for larger projects, it would be nice to have more thoughts from your planning process, such as a Trello board, and relevant wireframes.

## Technical Requirements

>Did you deliver a project that met all the technical requirements? Given what the class has covered so far, did you build something that was reasonably complex?

**Meets Expectations**. Congratulations, your project shows prolific use of the technologies and concepts we have covered so far! I think there is some easily identifiable low-hanging fruit that you could knock-out to add the finishing touches to increase functionality.

## Code Quality

>Did you follow code style guidance and best practices covered in class, such as spacing, modularity, and semantic naming? Did you comment your code as your instructors have in class?

**Meets Expectations**. Html is clearly structured and validated, CSS looks good, and JS works! Moving forward, try to think about ways to simplify your code, and provide effective wrappers for your data. Would recommend trying an object-oriented approach in the future. In the future, please remove unused/commented out code

## Problem Solving

>Are you able to defend why you implemented your solution in a certain way? Can you demonstrate that you thought through alternative implementations?

**Meets Expectations**
I like the approach you took to break down the logic of the game into functions with a clear separation of concerns. In general, I'd try to think of ways to simplify and reduce repetition.

Great job!
